Integrative Motion Analysis: Decoding Human Movement and Muscle Dynamics using Python

The project analyzes human motion and muscle activity using Python with the help of motion capture, EMG, LED tracking, and force plate measurements. The experimental setup involves a Motion Machine, EMG sensors, and LEDs to calibrate the experiment space. A wand with 8 LEDs is used for calibration, creating a skeleton framework. Once the calibration is complete, the subject performs various activities while their muscle activity is recorded using 16 EMG sensors. Additionally, a triangular stylus is used for calibration and pointing purposes. The subject stands on four force plates that measure ground reaction forces. Collected Data is processed with OpenSim to generate a mocap report, OpenCV to convert videos into mini-videos, extract individual frames, and remove unnecessary frames before the first LED activation and after the last LED activation using specific algorithms., and MediaPipe to determine subject coordinates.
