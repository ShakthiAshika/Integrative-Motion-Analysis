Integrative Motion Analysis: Decoding Human Movement and Muscle Dynamics using Python
The project analyzes human motion and muscle activity using Python with the help of motion capture, EMG, LED tracking, and force plate measurements. Data is processed with OpenSim to generate a mocap report, OpenCV to extract frames from videos, and MediaPipe to determine subject coordinates.
